# Array Method Exercises:

This repo contains array method exercises.

# Instructions:

You will do all of your coding in the `.js` files.

These have automatically been linked to HTML files for your convenience so you can easily see the console for each exercise.

All of the HTML files have navigation to the other exercises so you only need to start Live Server once and then you'll be able to navigate between exercises.

# Solutions:

Solutions have been provided in a folder nested in each of the different array method folders.

Make sure you attempt the exercises and do some research if you get stuck. Be sure to revisit the lessons if you can't remember how to use one of the array methods

# Additional content:

If you've finished the exercises and are itching to do more, head over to a code challenge website like [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/), sign-up and begin doing the exercises starting at the easiest rank first. Try and solve the questions using array methods, and be sure to check the solutions at the end that they show so you can see other approaches.
